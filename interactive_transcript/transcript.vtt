Wow. What an audience. But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk. I don't.

0:00:19 --> 0:00:26
I care what the internet thinks of my talk. Because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared. And I think that's where most people get it wrong. They're talking

0:00:26 --> 0:00:34
to you here, instead of talking to you random person scrolling Facebook. Thanks

0:00:34 --> 0:00:40
for the click. You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird little things called

0:00:40 --> 0:00:50
attention spans. Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed them. They're dead. I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED Talk. It's

0:00:50 --> 0:00:59
been years. Literally years. So if you're given a TED Talk, keep it quick. I'm doing mine in under a minute. I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means we

0:00:59 --> 0:01:08
got time for one final joke. Why are balloons so expensive? Inflation.
